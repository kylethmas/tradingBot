Areas for further development - Housekeeping
- Run entire package from one main.py script
- Reorder signal_genarotor functions to order that they are called.
- Add branching strategy and require code review before merging
- Fix virtual env

Areas for further development - Testing
- Add in unit testing and functional testing

Areas for further development - Shortterms Musts
- Linear model training and testing data should be different
- Allow for comparison of different algorithms in some sort of output e.g. graphs or saved file
- Make use of packages, e.g. algrithm names don't need to be hard coded into backtesting

Major Development Goals
- Trading strategy Algorithm Research and development
- More complex trading strategys
- Combining trading startegys
- Use testing data for day trading e.g. not over two years which is currently used
- Potential for trader bot to choose which stocks to hold and which stocks to sell from limited options
- Research API's which allow to buy and sell real stocks
